title: Generating Immune-aware SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins for Universal Vaccine Design
abstract: Dozens of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been approved for public use, yet there
  remains a risk that the virus evolves to escape vaccine protection. This motivates
  the development of universal vaccines capable of protecting against current and
  potentially new strains of the virus. A key challenge is the lack of computational
  tools to design new viral proteins capable of vaccine escape, which could serve
  as good targets for the development of universal vaccines. Here, we designed VAE
  capable of generating SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with variable immune visibility
  to the cell-mediated immune response. We compared our model with two simpler generative
  models; a random-mutator and an 11-gram language model. All three models can generate
  stable, structurally valid sequences, yet only the VAE model can generate low immunogenicity
  sequences that interpolate smoothly along the principal variance directions of known
  natural sequences. This model provides an effective computational tool for the generation
  of spike protein sequences useful for universal vaccine design. We provide its source
  code at https://github.com/hcgasser/SpikeVAE.
